# UI Directory

This directory is a placeholder for future TUI (Text User Interface) components.

## Planned Structure

```
ui/
├── screens/     # Full-screen TUI views
└── widgets/     # Reusable TUI widgets
```

## Status

Currently not implemented. The application uses:
- `main.py` - Console application with Rich library
- `web_ui/` - Web-based UI with React frontend

This directory may be used in the future for a dedicated terminal UI using libraries like Textual or Rich.
